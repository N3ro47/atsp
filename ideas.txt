2. Choose a cooling schedule

The cooling schedule is a crucial component of the SA algorithm, as it determines how the temperature decreases over time. Common cooling schedules include:

    Exponential cooling: T(k) = T0 * exp(-k/T0)
    Linear cooling: T(k) = T0 - k * alpha
    Adaptive cooling: T(k) = T0 / (1 + k/T0)

where T(k) is the temperature at iteration k, T0 is the initial temperature, and alpha is a parameter that controls the cooling rate.

3. Determine the initial temperature

The initial temperature T0 should be high enough to allow the algorithm to explore the solution space, but not so high that it gets stuck in an infinite loop. A common approach is to set T0 to a value that is 10-100 times the average distance between cities.

4. Determine the maximum number of iterations

The maximum number of iterations max_iter should be set based on the size of the problem instance and the desired level of accuracy. A common approach is to set max_iter to a value that is proportional to the number of cities n, such as max_iter = n^2 or max_iter = n^3.
