Final Thoughts

Look, I know what you're thinking. This project is held together with duct tape, hopes, and just a dash of chaos. But you know what? It works. It got the job done. It passed the class. That’s what matters, right?

So, if you dare to read the code, prepare yourself for:

    Variable names that probably don't make sense
    Comments that are more like vague prophecies
    A design that only a sleep-deprived student could love
    5 warings per file

Despite it all, this mess does its job—kind of like a car with a missing door but a great engine. And hey, it calculates the problem well, so there’s that.

If you find a bug, it’s probably a feature. If it breaks, you’re in for an adventure. And if you learn something from this, then I’m both impressed and a little worried for you.

Happy coding, and may your projects be more organized than this one.
